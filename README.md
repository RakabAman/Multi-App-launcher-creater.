# Multi-App-launcher-creater.
Application Launcher (PowerShell + WinForms)
#Overview
This project provides a simple Windows Forms GUI built in PowerShell that allows users to:

Select multiple executable (.exe) files.

Assign a priority level (Low, Normal, High) to each application.

Automatically generate a batch script that launches the selected applications with the chosen priority and CPU affinity.

It’s a lightweight tool for quickly creating customized launch scripts without manually editing batch files.

#Features
Executable selection: Pick one or more .exe files using a file dialog.

Priority assignment: Choose between Low, Normal, or High priority for each application.

Batch script generation: Automatically creates a .bat file with proper start commands.

Portable GUI: Runs entirely in PowerShell with no external dependencies.

#Usage
Run the PowerShell script:

powershell
.\ApplicationLauncher.ps1
Click Add Executables to select .exe files.

Choose a priority level from the right-hand list.

Select the applications you want to include.

Click Generate Batch to save a .bat file to your Desktop (or another location).

Run the generated batch file to launch your apps with the specified settings.
